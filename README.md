# LowPassFilter_Tool
This repository contains a demonstration of a custom Lp-norm-based filter in Python. The code in `lp_filter.py` performs signal processing on various types of signals (step, ramp, sine, or data read from CSV files), then plots the results.

## Features

- **LP Filter**: Implements an iterative Lp-based filter.
- **Signal Generation**: Generates step, ramp, and sine wave signals for testing.
- **CSV Reading**: Reads custom data from CSV files (e.g., if `number=3, 4, 5` is selected in `lp_filter`).
- **Plotting**: Visualizes the filtered output alongside the original signal.
